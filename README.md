# Installation using a Singularity container

We have created a recipe to use Singularity without worrying about installing CUDA and installing libraries. The container has gpuvmem compiled and all you need to work. Additionally, you can edit the recipe and add applications that you are interested in. To use the Singularity container, follow the next steps:

```bash
# Install Singularity, in this case we will follow the Linux instructions, but to install it on MAC see: https://singularity.lbl.gov/install-mac

sudo apt install squashfs-tools
VERSION=2.5.2
wget https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/download/$VERSION/singularity-$VERSION.tar.gz
tar xvf singularity-$VERSION.tar.gz
cd singularity-$VERSION
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install

#Now we can use Singularity to shell into the container
mkdir container # Make a directory in your workspace
singularity shell --nv shub://miguelcarcamov/container_docker:casacore.gpuvmem.9.2 #Use this command for CUDA 9.2
# singularity shell --nv shub://miguelcarcamov/container_docker:casacore.gpuvmem.10.0 #Use this command for CUDA 10.0
```

The gpuvmem binary should be in `/gpuvmem/bin`.

# Compiling

```bash
cd gpuvmem
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

# Now the antennas are read directly from the MS file


# Usage

Create your canvas or mod_in_0.fits with the image data on the header, typically we use the resulting dirty image from CASA tclean in FITS format.

Create your input.dat file with the following data and change the parameters as you need. For example if you want to reconstruct an image:

    noise_cut	100.5
    ftol		1.0e-12
    random_probability 1.0

Random probability it's the probability of how much data you want to get randomly from your entire dataset. If it is 0.5 you will get approximately half of your dataset randomly sampled. If it is 1.0 you will get your entire dataset.

# Use GPUVMEM:

    -h  --help             Shows this
    -X  --blockSizeX       Block X Size for Image (Needs to be pow of 2)

    --clipping             Clips the image to positive values
    --print-images         Prints images per iteration
    --print-errors         Prints final error images
    --verbose              Shows information through all the execution

# Framework usage

The normal flow of the program starts by creating a synthesizer, creating an optimizer, creating an objective function, and adding your terms to the objective function

All the objects must be created by their respective factory

The number of available images is determined by the -z command

Gridding can be applied both as a filter and as an input parameter

All the specializations of objects are listed in the enums

All filters can only be applied before using Synthesizer->setDevice()

The configuration of a Fi has as parameters, the index of its penalty factor (-Z), the index of the image from where the data will be calculated, and finally the index of the image where the results of the calculations will be applied.

# IMPORTANT

Remember to create the mem folder to save the FITS images

# Fixes

We have fixed the Makefile and now you can compile gpuvmem using the new version of casacore.

# TO RESTORE YOUR IMAGE PLEASE SEE CARCAMO ET AL. 2018 FOR MORE INFORMATION

-   This will return a restored image: A convolution of the model image with the CLEAN BEAM + residuals (JY/BEAM)
-   Residuals (JY/BEAM)
-   The script file is on the scripts folder and it is named restore_continuum_ms_SC.py

Restoring usage:

```bash
casa --nologger -c restore_continuum_ms_SC.py residual_folder.ms mem_model.fits restored_output 2.0
```

The last parameter, is the robust parameter that you want to use to clean the residuals.
